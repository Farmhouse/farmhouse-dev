# IUI

Markup and styles for the Inventory UI


## Requirements

styles.css
bootstrap-collapse.js

## Usage

The index page is the select floorplan page. Step 2 is found in select-unit.html. Step 3 is in request-unit.html. The final step is the confirmation page in thank-you.html.

There are comments in the markup to explain different pieces. Contact Chad Crissman (chad.crissman@getg5.com) with question.
